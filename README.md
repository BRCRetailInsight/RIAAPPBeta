# RIA APP Public Beta
Retail Insight App Public version (beta)
These files create: 
      (a) a shiny dashboard with an interactive dygraph using ONS time series data 
      (b) A simple tool for string searching tweets for particular words and presenting as a wordle.
      
The plan is to develop it adding more tabs displaying different types of data e.g. Total retail market size, geospatial data relevant to retail, and to include small bits of text, by way of explanation.

Thoughts, Feedback and contributions welcome!
